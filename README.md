# Agar.io-Clone-CSharp-WinForms

A duplication of the multiplayer game Agar.io written in C# and Windows form application

# Playing the Game
To run the game you must have an instance of *Program.cs* running in ThreadedTCPserver folder. You can then connect as many clients as you'd like by running *Form1.cs* in the GameTest folder.

# Game Mechanics
- The game will begin once a client connects on the same machine the server is running on
- Orb collisions
- Player collisions

# Possible Erros
If you are having connections issues try diabsling the firewall on the server and client machines.
